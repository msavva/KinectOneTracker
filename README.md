# KinectOneTracker
A simple recording utility for the KinectOne sensor.

## Build
Download [biicode](www.biicode.org) and run `bii build`.

## Prerequisites
- [Kinect SDK v2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/)
- [Lagarith lossless codec](http://lags.leetcode.net/codec.html)
- KinectOne sensor connected to USB3 port
- Internal dependencies on OpenCV and Boost are handled by biicode

## Run

Start compiled binary in bin folder to record.  Press a key to stop recording, and save files.  Each recording is stored as a JSON header containing skeletal tracking information (see [Recording.cpp](KinectOneTracker/Recording.cpp)), and two AVI files encoded losslessly with Lagarith: one for depth and the other for color.

Some basic parameters are currently hardcoded in [main.cpp](KinectOneTracker/main.cpp#L21):
- id : recording id used as prefix in files
- fps : frames per second for depth and color video
- showCapture : whether to show live depth and color frames
